This is the list that is maintained by SpamKeywords.com.

These keywords are what we have found to be common in spam comments and posts.  

We decided to host this list on github due to the ease of maintaining and sharing the list.

If you have a website or blog, please link to SpamKeywords.com so that we can increase the traffic to our network of honey pots and have a better chance of adding spam keywords to the list.
